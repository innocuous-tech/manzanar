00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.837
"No No"s like Ichiro
were sent to Tule Lake.

2
00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:09.050
Tule Lake was a maximum security camp
with armed sentries ready to shoot,

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.762
observing the incarcerated with suspicion.

4
00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:19.978
Shoichi James Okamoto was
one of the 18,700 incarcerated at Tule Lake.

5
00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:23.106
On May 24th, 1944,

6
00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:27.527
Okamoto, while driving a construction
truck back and forth between the camp

7
00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:32.157
and the worksite outside the camp,
was stopped by a center-gate sentry

8
00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:36.661
demanding that Okamoto
step out of his truck and show his pass.

9
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:41.708
Okamoto stepped out of the
cab but refused to show his pass,

10
00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.754
whereupon the sentry struck
him on the shoulder with his rifle

11
00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:51.134
the two exchanged words,
and the sentry shot Okamoto.

12
00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:54.220
The next day, he died.

13
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.765
He was 30 years old.

14
00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:02.145
At the court-martial trial,
the sentry was acquitted of the homicide

15
00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:07.108
and only charged one dollar
for the cost of the bullet.
