1
00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:03.545
February 19th, 1942,

2
00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:09.467
Franklin D. Roosevelt
signed and issued Executive Order 9066,

3
00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:13.138
which led to the incarceration
of at least 120,000 people

4
00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:17.684
of Japanese descent,
two thirds of them American citizens.

5
00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.812
These people were stripped
of their livelihood without due process

6
00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:23.815
in violation of their Fifth Amendment
rights.

7
00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:27.736
In 1943, the incarcerated were given
a loyalty questionnaire

8
00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:31.156
with questions 27
and 28 being most controversial.

9
00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.824
Question 27 asked

10
00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:37.829
whether they would be willing
to serve in combat for the United States.

11
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.333
Question 28 asked whether they
would forswear allegiance to the Japanese emperor.

12
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:46.212
A loaded question asking about an emperor
that ruled over land

13
00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:49.549
that many of them
have never stepped foot in.

14
00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:54.304
Those who answer to no and no to
those questions were called “No No”s.

15
00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:59.100
They were considered enemies of the state
and taken to maximum security prisons.

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.645
You're about to meet Ichiro,
a fictional Japanese-American

17
00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:07.609
incarcerated in the
Manzanar concentration camp.
